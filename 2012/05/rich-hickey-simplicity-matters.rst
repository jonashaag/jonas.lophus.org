title: Simplicity Matters

Rich Hickey (the creator of the Clojure_ programming language) gave a talk_ about
simplicity in programming languages at this year's RailsConf.

I couldn't agree more with his opinions. The thing that makes a programming
languages a joy to use is them being simple -- that is, having only very few
core concepts that are easy to grasp and building the whole language ecosystem
around them.

Javascript is a good example of a simple programming language. Its key concepts
are functions and objects (hashtables).  But everyone knows Javascript sucks_
because of its complex prototype inheritance behavior, weak typing and
syntax absurdities.

Clojure is another prime example of a simple programming language and it'd be
my coding language of choice if it weren't for the JVM.
