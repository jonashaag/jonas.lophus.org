title: Building It Right vs. Building The Right It

`Testing is Dead <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1jWe5rOu3g>`_ or
Build it *right* vs. building the right *it* -- great talk by
`Alberto Savoia <http://albertosavoia.com>`_.

Summary: Make sure you build the right "it" before you build it right.
Don't waste your time building the product perfectly (e.g. by doing extensive
testing) before you know anyone's going to use the product in the first place.
For that to know, use `Pretotyping <http://pretotyping.org>`_, which basically
means to mock your idea and test it under real-world conditions (i.e.  with real
users) in order to see if it's actually worth building the product. When you
know it's the right it, you can start building it right.  Not the other way round.

His book, "`Pretotype It <http://www.pretotyping.org/pretotype-it---the-book>`_",
also looks like a nice read (free PDF):

   This is not a "proper book."

   Writing and editing a proper book on the subject of pretotyping would
   take months. I would love to write that book, but at this time I have no
   indication that such a book would be worth writing. Most books fail in
   the market, and most of them fail not because they are poorly written or
   edited, but because there aren't enough people interested in them. They
   are not the right *it*.

   What you are reading now is a pretotype edition of the book. I wrote and
   "edited" it in days instead of months, just to test the level of interest
   in such a book. I had a few friends and colleagues review it, but don't be
   surprised if you find typos, misspellings, bad grammar, awkward formatting
   and all sorts of *misteaks*.
