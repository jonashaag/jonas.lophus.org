title: Facebook is going to die

Within the next three or so years, Facebook will considerably lose market share.
That's due to multiple reasons. Among them (all interconnected in some way):

* Facebook missed the mobile market. Just like Microsoft with the Internet,
  Facebook underestimated the importance of mobile communication.
  They have a really crappy Android app and the iOS version is even worse.
  I don't think they're going to recover from that. Microsoft didn't and people
  are already starting to prefer alternative communication platforms like
  WhatsApp (which is growing in terms of features, turning from a text-only app
  into a general social network).
* Facebook is register-only -- which isn't a bad thing per se. But the main
  promise of being register-only is to keep the reputation of being for serious
  communcation -- which Facebook is losing slowly: News feeds have turned the
  from personal, authentic "What's happening in my life" thing into a meme stream.
  I hear people complaining about meme spam all the time.
* Facebook has too many features, being a giant time waster. Instead of focussing
  on the core social needs, that is, staying in touch with far-away friends,
  making reallife appointments with nearby friends, sharing photos/videos of
  truly precious reallife experiences (NOT PARTY PICS), it has turned into an
  enormous "mixture of meme shit and worthless party pics and re-posts from
  Twitter" beast.  People don't see value in Facebook anymore.

I don't think there's any way for Facebook to escape this trend.
They messed things up and that's it.
