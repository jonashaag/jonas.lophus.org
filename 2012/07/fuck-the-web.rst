title: Fuck the Web

`Awesome talk by Zed Shaw <http://vimeo.com/43380467>`_ about the current state
of the Web. Summary: Fuck HTML, fuck CSS, Javascript, uploads, in-browser video.
Fuck Web creation tools. Fuck HTTP. Fuck OOP. Fuck functional programming.
The Web will be replaced by something usable at some point, just like OOP.

It's sad but so so true. While HTML might as well make it into the Next-Web
technique stack, CSS will not. CSS is an unbelievable crap. Zed Shaw is right
when he says all we want is a fucking simple layout language. Not something that
makes us do ``margin: 0 auto``, ``position: absolute/relative``, ``overflow``,
``float``, ``clear``, ``em vs. px vs. %`` shitfuck.
I want a layout engine that I tell "put this left", "put this right, and btw
it's a sidebar, so don't put any of the main content in here". "Center this."

Also, Javascript. Javascript needs to die. It's already slowly being replaced
by sane languages such as Dart and CoffeeScript.  Although I wonder why Mozilla
and Google spend tons of money building a super fast Javascript JIT instead of
inventing a sane, simply, compiled language. In the same breath they should have
replaced the DOM by something that people actually understand.
Fuck CSS selectors, IDs, XPath. Why can't we just have Web components?
Like a button, a sidebar, header, image, paragraph.

Google, when you're done introducing SPDY, please replace CSS. Then Javascript.
Then HTML. Please do.
