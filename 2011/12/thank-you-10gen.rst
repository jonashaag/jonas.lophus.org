title: Thank you 10gen

So I'm one of the `MongoDB Masters`_ and therefore have been invited to attend
the first MongoMasters Summit and MongoSV_ 2011 in Santa Clara (Silicon Valley).

I really appreciate having been invited to the Masters program, particularly
because it's so incredibly well-organized.
For example I've been picked up at the San Francisco airport to be transferred
to the hotel they've booked for all the Masters.
I have been reimbursed for all travel costs which is very important to me at least
(students usually don't have money to burn :-)
I didn't even need to manage anything on my own, things just happened.

I'm convinced `Meghan Gill`_, 10gen's Community Manager, played a major role in
organizing the Masters Summit -- Meghan definitely knows how to do her job.

So does 10gen. 10gen is doing it right.
I actually think 10gen's the first Free Software company that has such a
"key community members" group in the first place, at least I'm not aware of
anything comparable in the Free Software world.

I think most people (me included) don't expect companies to maintain such
relationships to key community members at all.
But maybe we should because for a company that makes Free Software, having a
great and actively evolving community is everything.

10gen wants to make their community want to stay. They had at least some success
with that so far -- I will certainly stay.
